## Introduction

**Why AnimeMatch?**  
As a lifelong anime fan, I‚Äôve always faced the same problem: How do I find anime that truly speaks to my tastes, mood, and interests? We often rely on broad genres or user ratings, but these can be limiting. **What if anime recommendations were based on the complexity of our own personalities?** This idea inspired me to create AnimeMatch, a platform that tailors anime suggestions to your personality traits and refines them based on feedback.

From day one, my vision was to create a system that feels like it's ‚Äúlistening‚Äù to you, learning from your feedback, and offering anime suggestions that aren't just popular‚Äîbut personal.

> "AnimeMatch is about finding an anime that not only entertains you but resonates with you on a deeper level."

## Technical Details ‚öôÔ∏è

### Tech Stack

AnimeMatch leverages modern web development tools and libraries for a smooth and efficient user experience:
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (custom styles + media queries), JavaScript (ES6+), Axios (for API communication)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js for API endpoints
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user profiles and feedback history
- **API**: Axios handles HTTP requests for seamless communication between the frontend and backend
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub for collaborative development

### Recommendation Algorithm

The heart of AnimeMatch is its **Personality-Based Recommendation Algorithm**. Here‚Äôs a deep dive into how it works:

1. **Personality Trait Mapping**: Users select traits like "Optimistic" or "Anxious." Each trait is mapped to anime genres or themes. For instance, an optimistic personality might be mapped to genres like "Slice of Life" or "Adventure," while a calm user might lean towards "Drama" or "Mystery."

2. **User Feedback Loop**: After watching an anime, users can submit feedback. This feedback is stored in the database and influences future recommendations. For example, if you disliked a recommendation, similar anime will be deprioritized in future suggestions.

3. **Recommendation Refinement**: The system uses a basic scoring algorithm based on your feedback. The algorithm calculates weighted scores for each genre based on your likes/dislikes. This ensures that recommendations become more tailored over time.

4. **Next Iteration**: In future updates, I plan to implement **collaborative filtering** (similar to Netflix's recommendation engine), which will suggest anime based on users with similar tastes.

### Challenges & Solutions üí°

1. **Handling Asynchronous API Calls**: Initially, I struggled with managing the complexity of multiple asynchronous API requests for recommendation updates. The solution was to implement **Axios** to handle all HTTP requests, simplifying the code while maintaining efficiency.

2. **Responsive Design**: One of the most challenging parts was ensuring the UI was fully responsive across devices. With CSS media queries and testing, I ensured that AnimeMatch performs beautifully on both mobile and desktop.

3. **User Feedback Integration**: Translating user feedback into meaningful data was tricky. I solved this by implementing a weighted scoring system, which adjusts recommendations based on user feedback in real-time.
